# Storage Deivces

Storage is used by a computer to store hard copies of data.

## M.2 SSD

M.2 SSD's are the fastest storage devices on the market. They are small and can be mounted directly to the motherboard. This allows for faster read and write speeds, which is primarily helpful for those who move large files to and from drives. They have recently become significantly more affordable than they were in the past.

## Sata SSD

Sata SSD's are the second fastest storage devices on the market. They are larger than M.2 SSD's and require a sata cable to connect to the motherboard. They are still significantly faster than HDD's and are a great option for those who need fast storage but their motherboard does not neccessarily support and M.2 SSD.

## HDD

HDD's are the slowest storage devices on the market. They are large and require a sata cable to connect to the motherboard. They are significantly slower than SSD's but are also significantly cheaper. They use spinning disks to store data and a physical read/write head to access the data. Though due to cost per gigabyte, they still have a place for those who need very large amounts of storage.
